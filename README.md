# odin-recipes
Practice using skills from The Odin Project's Foundation Course. (Due to a long gap in my studies, I am starting from the basics to make sure I remember how to do things)

First task is to create a simple website with HTML.
It should include:

    1) an index page
    2) links to a few recipes

Second task is to make that site fancy with CSS, which shall be done at a later time.
